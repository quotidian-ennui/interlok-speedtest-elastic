# interlok-speedtest-elastic [![Interlok Hammer](https://img.shields.io/badge/certified-interlok%20hammer-red.svg)]()

This is clearly a case of when all you have is a hammer; everything looks like a nail...

* Get https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli, old-skool style, and put it somewhere.
* Get ElasticSearch and start it
    * Example index available (though I'm not sure that the geo_point stuff is right).
* Get Kibana and start it
* Configure your interlok instance with JSON, CSV, ElasticSearch
* Leave it running for a bit, and do your visualisations.
